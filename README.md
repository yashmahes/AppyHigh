I have build a simple Django powered web application that takes a food item as text input and displays its macronutrients. New food items and its data can be added in the database through any registered user.

BackEnd
The candidates need to build the application through the below approach only
● Set up a Mysql DB and upload the data attached ( Download Link ) in that DB

● Logged in user should be able to add any food item in the database
● In addition to the application, build a rest API that takes that same text string as input
and throws its macronutrients data as JSON
UI
● The home screen should have a text input option for searching any food item and getting
data for its macronutrients
● There should be an option for submitting a food item and its macronutrients data
●
● Login/SignUp. Logged in users should see there name as - "Hi XX
